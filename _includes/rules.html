                <p>The rules are not that serious. Basically, don't get hurt, and don't be a jerk. Specifically:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No slide tackling</li>
                    <li>Minimal contact</li>
                    <li>Don't yell at other players</li>
                    <li>Be nice</li>
                </ul>
                
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <p>Also, we typically play on a turf field, so turf shoes are recommended, but normal running shoes can work fine. Some wear shin guards, some don't.</p>
